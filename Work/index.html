                    <p>Researching ways to expedite data analysis with Computer Vision. Currently, I am working on accurately identifying charcoal contours from image samples, 
                        which are no bigger than 5mm across, such that the script can accurately estimate the number of charcoal pieces in the entire sample, numbering in the thousands,
                        which would significantly reduce the time and error compared to a manual count. I am using the OpenCV library for its Computer Vision modules to help with this.

                    <p>Was contracted to build a rewards program application for 2 stores, Poke Parlor and Pokeholics. Solo-developed a mobile application, web portal, and set up a
                        database server to store customer data. Built the mobile application for Android (Xamarin, C#), the website on ASP.NET (C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and the database
                        through MS SQL Server. Unfortunately, the code contains sensitive data for the application so I cannot release it publicly.
