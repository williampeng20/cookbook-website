                <p>My name is William Peng, and I'm a senior studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I'm passionate about both coding and photography,
                with an interest in their intersection (computer vision). I have experiene in front-end development, back-end development, and
                computer vision.</p>
                <p>In the front-end, I've worked on desktop applications (JavaFX), mobile applications (Android Studio, Swift), and web applications
                (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Web Toolkit, ASP.NET).</p>
                <p>In the back-end, I've built a web platform's back-end architecture, as well as integration with various DBMS for different projects
                (PostgreSQL, AWS RDS, MS SQL Server, SQLite).</p>
                <p>In the area of computer vision, I'm currently doing research on using computer vision to detect and count charcoal samples for an environmental
                lab using the OpenCV library. Once the general algorithm is completed, I'll be porting it over onto a mobile app for the researchers at the lab to use.</p>
                <p>I'm currently looking for more projects to work on, as well as a full-time job starting in May 2019. If you have any questions or want to talk,
                feel free to reach out to me through one of the links below!</p>
